# Reinforcement 2048
This is a reinforcement learning program I wrote using Python's PyTorch library that learns how to play 2048. I love 2048 and I love coding, and this is the perfect project: if I can beat the AI at 2048, then I must be good at the game. If the AI can beat me, however, then I must be a good programmer. It's a total win-win.
